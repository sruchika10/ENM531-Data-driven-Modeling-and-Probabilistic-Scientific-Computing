Generate $5000$ realizations for $(z_1, z_2)$ from $p(z_1,z_2)$ and compute the corresponding $(x_1, x_2)$ pairs according to the given transformation. Then, maximize the log-likelihood of the $(x_1, x_2)$ observations to estimate the parameters of the forward mapping that transforms $p(z)$ into $p(x)$ (consider a polynomial basis). Report the learned parameters, log-likelihood loss and a visualization of $p(x)$ at every step of your gradient ascent algorithm.\n"
